## My AI Usage

This project was developed with support from AI tools to improve productivity, maintain code quality, and accelerate debugging. Below is a transparent overview of how AI assisted throughout the development process.

### ** AI Tools Used**

- **ChatGPT (OpenAI)**
- **GitHub Copilot (VS Code Extension)**

---

### How I Used AI\*\*

I used AI as a coding assistant—not as a replacement for my own development work.
Here are the specific ways AI was used:

#### **1. Planning & Architecture**

- Used **ChatGPT** to outline the overall architecture of the Sweet Shop Management System (frontend + backend).
- Asked AI for guidance on structuring:

  - Routes and controllers
  - React folder organization
  - Environment variable usage
  - Database schema design for Sweet, User, and Purchase logic

#### **2. Debugging**

- Used **ChatGPT** to debug:

  - Express routing issues
  - JWT authentication errors
  - Vercel deployment failures (case-sensitive file names, build failures)
  - Render backend environment issues

- Asked AI to explain error messages in detail and suggest fixes.

#### **3. Code Assistance**

- Used **GitHub Copilot** for:

  - Auto-completing repetitive React component boilerplate
  - Generating initial versions of service functions (API calls)
  - Suggesting test case skeletons for Jest

- Asked **ChatGPT** to help refactor pieces of code for:

  - Cleaner controller functions
  - REST API structure
  - Integrating purchase & restock logic

#### **4. UI & UX Improvements**

- Used AI suggestions for:

  - Improving form layouts
  - Adding better error messages
  - Organizing Admin Dashboard interactions
  - Designing a professional README structure

#### **5. Documentation**

- Used **ChatGPT** to help write:

  - Project description
  - Feature breakdown
  - Setup instructions
  - This “My AI Usage” section

---

### ** Reflection: How AI Impacted My Workflow**

Using AI significantly improved my development workflow:

- **Faster problem-solving:**
  Whenever I hit an unexpected error (especially deployment-related), AI helped quickly identify root causes and solutions.

- **Higher code quality:**
  With AI recommendations, I improved structure, readability, and separation of concerns across backend controllers and React components.

- **Better learning:**
  Instead of simply giving answers, AI explained _why_ something works, helping me understand concepts like:

  - Mongoose schema behavior
  - Express middleware
  - Vercel vs. Render deployment differences
  - State management in React

- **More efficient development:**
  Tasks that usually take hours—debugging, structuring, documentation—became much faster.

**However, all final logic, architectural decisions, testing, and debugging verification were done by me.
AI acted as a supportive tool, not an auto-builder.**

## Test Report (Summary)

 **Jest + Supertest**.

| Category                        | Tests   | Status   |
| ------------------------------- | ------- | -------- |
| Authentication (Register/Login) | 4 tests |  Passed |
| Sweets Search API               | 4 tests |  Passed |
| Sweet Purchase API              | 2 tests |  Passed |
| Sweet CRUD (Create/List/Delete) | 4 tests |  Passed |
| Auth Middleware                 | 2 tests |  Passed |
| Database Connectivity           | 1 test  |  Passed |
| Restock API                     | 2 tests |  Failed |
| Update Sweet API                | 1 test  |  Failed |

###  Failed Tests

* **Restock Sweet API**

  * Missing required `username` and `password` in test user creation.
* **Update Sweet API**

  * Unauthorized access (401) instead of expected 200.

###  Test Command

You can run the test suite using:

```bash
npm test
```
